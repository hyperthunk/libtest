- hamcrest style matchers (for literate testing)
- stubbing mechanisms for OTP behaviors (registration based or otherwise)

- TODO

- collector process/server to handle the incoming calls from mocks/stubs
- configure the collector at the API level
- wrap emock with driver that pushes to the collector process
    - do we await confirmation from the collector that the interaction succeeds?
    - or provide a verification step (via the API) whose invocation checks post test
    - or provide both and expose a mechanism to choose between the two
